# MemePet development setup

Current setup for the existing Next.js app. Historical scaffolding tasks are complete.

## Requirements

- Node **24.19.x** (`.nvmrc`) and npm **11.19.x** (`packageManager`).
- Foundry for contract tests and local-chain work; the application can run without it.
- Network access for live RPC reads and build-time Google Fonts downloads.

## Install and run

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The committed
[`DEPLOYMENT`](../src/lib/deployment.ts) points to X Layer testnet, chain **1952**,
registry `0xe844152262D243a7B90F6e07FF7A67F1d7FeD216`. No environment override is
needed for the public testnet setup. Browsing needs no wallet; transactions need
an injected wallet and testnet gas.

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

With Foundry installed:

```bash
cd contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-git
cd ..
npm run test:contracts
```

`npm test` is a non-interactive Vitest run. CI also starts the production build
and asserts `/` returns 200 and `/dev/pet`, `/dev/landing`, `/dev/community`
return 404. For local production inspection, use `npm run start` after building.
A test pass does not establish a real wallet transaction.

## Developer previews

Run the development server and open:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/dev/pet` | Fictional stage/care states, celebration and callback counters |
| `/dev/landing` | Landing presentation and navigation callback |
| `/dev/community` | Loading, zero, growing, achieved, unavailable and unknown-target states |

Previews carry **UI preview — fictional data** labels, never award chain progress,
and are unavailable in production. Keep them for repeatable visual and error-state QA.

## Separate local Anvil setup

Use this only for an isolated local test. Local state is not X Layer evidence.

1. Start `anvil` on its default loopback RPC `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (chain 31337).
2. Deploy using an **unlocked local Anvil account's public address**:

   ```bash
   forge create --root contracts src/PetRegistry.sol:PetRegistry \
     --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --unlocked \
     --from <LOCAL_TEST_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
   ```

3. Copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env.local`; fill the local status,
   name, chain, RPC and actual deployed registry address together. Set the local
   gas symbol to `ETH`. Never add signing material or an invented address.
4. Restart development, or rebuild production. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` configuration is
   baked into the client bundle.
5. Follow the [wallet walkthrough](qa/BROWSER_WALKTHROUGH.md), labelling every
   observation as local. Use [wallet setup](qa/WALLET_SETUP.md) for human preparation.

Remove local overrides when returning to the committed X Layer configuration.
Keep Anvil bound to loopback; do not use unlocked-node commands on a public network.
Public deployment procedures remain in [the X Layer runbook](deploy/XLAYER_TESTNET.md).

## Troubleshooting

- Stop a running Next.js server before `npm ci` on Windows if it reports `EPERM`.
- Resolve an occupied port rather than leaving duplicate test servers running.
- If `forge` is unavailable, check the Foundry installation/PATH. UI-only work does
  not require it.
- `next/font` needs network access during a clean production build.
- Use the pinned Node/npm versions and committed lockfile when reproducing CI.

## Evidence and current work

Current acceptance work lives in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md). Actual checks and their
limits are in [dated QA evidence](qa/evidence/) and linked GitHub CI runs.
The old setup file's unique local-node and automated results are preserved in
[the dated verification history](https://github.com/Chi944/memepet/blob/a8c14cb8a54181487d41ab752212407fab3c1c64/docs/DEV_SETUP.md#actual-verification).
Those records remain historical; no browser pass is inferred from them.
