# QA evidence

Current observations and historical runs are separate. Tests are not wallet
passes, and a recovered read does not erase an earlier failed refresh.

## Current records

- [Latest-release wallet QA](LATEST_RELEASE_QA_2026-09-24.md): current account/network transitions and follow-up care observations.
- [Final capture and video QC](FINAL_CAPTURE_2026-09-24.md): Account 2 receipts, adoption read-error recovery, failed community refresh, genuine stills, source hashes and completed-video checks.
- [First real browser acceptance](FINAL_ACCEPTANCE_2026-09-24.md): earlier wallet's care/cooldown/reload/public view; community header initially stale.
- [Larm's browser audit](LARM_FINAL_BROWSER_QA.md): four viewport layouts, keyboard/preview/error checks, with reduced-motion and foreground playback gaps kept explicit.

## Historical audit trail

Older reports and their original screenshots are preserved at commit
**19c3fac1f097955f2b6e409ab2f4ab988abc0cee** rather than duplicated in the active
submission tree. These links retain failures, blocked wallet attempts and
withdrawn findings; cleanup does not rewrite their results.
